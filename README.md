ðŸ”§ðŸ§  To forge and fire a spear of the sky ðŸš€ðŸŽ¯
One must first whisper in binary to the wind:
an algorithmâ€”the mind behind the metalâ€”
that dances with data from the gyroscope's spin,
the accelerometerâ€™s pulse,
the magnetometerâ€™s whisper,
and all silent sensors in between.

Each byte, a brick.
Each signal, a spark.
Each calculation, a compass toward precision divine.

For a year I toiledâ€”âŒ›
not in war,
but in logicâ€™s cathedral,
where code becomes clarity and numbers never miss.

And nowâ€”
ðŸŽ¯ Bon appÃ©tit, you enemies of peace.
Let precision be your punishment.
Let justice arrive, swift and silent.
